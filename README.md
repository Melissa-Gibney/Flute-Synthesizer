# Flute Synthesizer
This is a flute synthesizer coded in Max, based on research by Perry R. Cook.

The Flute_Synthesizer_Project.maxpat file contains the code I wrote for this project.
This code was written and operates in Max version 8.2.2.

The Flute_Synthesizer_Project_Paper.pdf is a research paper that I wrote just
after completing this project. It includes a technical overview of each section
of the project pipeline and also explains how these sections related back to
Perry Cook's research, along with how the output of my code compares to Cook's
project.
