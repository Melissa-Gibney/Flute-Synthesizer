# Flute Synthesizer
This is a flute synthesizer coded in Max, based on research by Perry R. Cook.

The Flute_Synthesizer_Project.maxpat file contains the code I wrote for this project.
This code was written in Max version 8.2.2.

The Flute_Synthesizer_Project_Paper.pdf is a research paper that I wrote just
after completing this project. It includes a technical overview of each section
of the project pipeline, explains how these sections related back to
Perry Cook's research, and compares the output of my code to Cook's project.
